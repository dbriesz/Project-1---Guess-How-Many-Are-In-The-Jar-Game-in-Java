# jar-guessing-game

Fills a jar with a random number of items and the player guesses the number of items in the jar.  Upon successfully guessing the number of items, the game displays how many tries the player took in order to guess the correct answer.  The player is warned if their guess is higher than the maximum fill amount (this does not count against the number of tries).  The player is given a hint if their guess is lower or higher than the correct number.
